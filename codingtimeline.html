<h2> Descritpion</h2>
    <p>My story began in 2015, when my brother approached my and questioned my career path. My mind with blank as I had never thought about that before. 
    He suggested game developer due to my massive interest in Nintendo products at the time. I quickly sai dno due to the nature of that feild. 
    He then suggested software engineering. I barley knew anything of that word. HE described the discription of the job, my eyes sparkled, and wtih a smile, I asked my brother, how do I start. 
    Since then I have been tryiong to indulgdge into the world of coding. I tired Codecademy, watching Youtubers guide into Python and JS, and much more. I tried XCode in the year 2016. 
    I was interested in that code because it is the language people of Apple would to code our iPhones and MacBooks. As an Apple find, you better not think I would pass an oppotunity to learn this code.
    WHen I came to TLK in grade 9, they gave me and some other firend the task to edit the robotic's team website (JS and HTML). Since we came in with barley an experirence in coding, 
    we failed to complete the task, in which a senior took over (thank god). Then, I was given the task as coding editor. My friends cided the bot as they had more experience and I would just go 
    back and revise the code as needed. Come 2019, I decided to offically induldge back into XCode and attempted to develop an app with a guide. I failed do so not only because I was inexperienced, 
    but also my code died along with my 2015 MacBook Air as they drowned in water. As of Spetember 2019, I am in the class ICS 3U to relearn code all over again.</p>
