  Not really. I am opening to learning anything in any language, however I hope we have some project (marked or for fun) where we get to learn the basics in building an app(least likley that itwill happpen but just a hope)
  
Why did you sign up for this class? You can be honest.

  I am considereding software engineering / slaes engineering as a futuer occupation but also part of me wanted to do this course for fun because from my small experience of coding, I find it fun (sorry if that is a unproffessional or unsufficient reasoning for enrolling into this course).
